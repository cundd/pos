Stairtower
==========

Stairtower is a (experimental) database server for schema-free, JSON documents, that provides a restful API and is entirely written in PHP.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cundd/stairtower.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cundd/stairtower)

The software is in ~~alpha state~~ an early alpha state and not ready for production. The biggest parts of the API are defined and major parts are covered by unit tests. Nevertheless there is much to improve.
